# npm resolution error report

While resolving: mb-marie-banque@1.0.0
Found: zod@3.24.2
node_modules/zod
  zod@"3.24.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer zod@"^3.25.0 || ^4.0.0" from drizzle-zod@0.8.3
node_modules/drizzle-zod
  drizzle-zod@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
